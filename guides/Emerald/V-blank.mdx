## What are V-blanks?

A V-blank interrupt is the mechanism used by the GBA to refresh the screen. It is triggered every 1/60th of a second independently from regular game logic execution.

When a V-blank interrupt occurs, the regular game program execution is paused, v-blank associated code is executed, then the regular game program resumes.

In GBA Pokemon games, the v-blank associated code updates the RNG frame by 1. This means that every 1/60th of a second, the RNG frame updates by 1.


## Impact of V-blanks
Here's the simplified logic for Pokémon generation:

| Step          | Frame At Step Start | Frame At Step End |
| ----------------- | --------------------|-------------------|
| Generate PID      | 1      | 2 |
| Generate IVs      | 2      | 3 |

In most cases, this is exactly what happens, and the Pokemon is generating with RNG frame 1 and 2.

However, in some rare cases, a v-blank occurs seemingly out of nowhere and alters the generation:

| Step          | Frame At Step Start | Frame At Step End |
| ----------------- | --------------------|-------------------|
| Generate PID               | 1      | 2 |
| V-BLANK: Update RNG frame  | 2  | 3 |
| Generate IVs               | 3  | 4 |

Even though the Pokémon generation started on the same frame, the resulting IVs are different because they were generated with frame 3 instead of frame 2.

## Understanding V-blanks Frequency
As stated before, a v-blank occurs every 1/60th of a second, more specifically every 280'896 CPU instruction cycles.

Every operation performed by the GBA (ex: addition, loading data) takes a certain number of CPU instruction cycles.

The more instruction cycles a Pokémon generation step takes, the more likely a v-blank will occur during it.
  - Ex: A step that takes ~28'000 cycles will have ~10% chance to have a v-blank.
  - Ex: A step that takes 300'000 cycles is guaranteed to have at least 1 v-blank, possibly 2.

The generation of a stationary Pokemon takes few instructions, which makes v-blank rare.

In the other hand, wild Pokémon generation with a Synchronize leader can take a lot of instructions, which makes v-blank a lot more common.

Fortunately, in most cases, v-blanks occuring during the Pokémon generation don't actually impact the resulting Pokémon. But sometimes, they do impact and cause what we call [Methods 2-4](/gba-methods).
