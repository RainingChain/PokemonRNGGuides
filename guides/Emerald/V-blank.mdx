## What are V-blanks?

A V-blank interrupt is the mechanism used by the GBA to refresh the screen. It is triggered every 1/60th of a second independently from regular game logic execution.

When a V-blank interrupt occurs, the regular game program execution is paused, v-blank associated code is executed, then the regular game program resumes.

In GBA Pokemon games, the v-blank associated code updates the RNG frame by 1. This means that every 1/60th of a second, the RNG frame updates by 1.


## Impact of V-blanks
Here's the logic for Pokémon generation:

```
Generate PID  (ex: frame 1000)
Update RNG frame
Generate IVs  (frame 1001)
Update RNG frame
```

In most cases, this is exactly what happens.

However, in some rare cases, a v-blank occurs seemingly out of nowhere and alters the generation:

```
Generate PID  (frame 1000)
Update RNG frame
Update RNG frame (caused by v-blank)
Generate IVs  (frame 1002)
Update RNG frame
```

Even though the Pokémon generation started on the same frame, the resulting IVs are different.

## Understanding V-blanks Frequency
As stated before, a v-blank occurs every 1/60th of a second, more specially every 280'896 CPU instruction cycles.

Every operation performed by the GBA (ex: addition, loading data) takes a certain number of CPU instruction cycles.

The more instructions a Pokémon generation step takes, the more likely a v-blank will occur during it.
  - Ex: A Pokémon generation step that takes ~28'000 instruction cycles will have ~10% chance to have a v-blank.
  - Ex: A step that takes 300'000 cycles is guaranteed to have at least 1 v-blank, possibly 2.

The generation of stationary takes very few instructions, which makes v-blank very rare.

In the other hand, wild Pokémon generation with a Synchronize leader can take a lot of instructions, which makes v-blank a lot more common.

Check [Method 1-4](gba-methods) for more information about the concrete impact of v-blanks on Pokémon generation.
