Gist: Understanding the particularities, the key RNG concepts, and version differences of GBA games.

### Particularities of GBA RNG Manipulation

In GBA games, the RNG frame advances every in-game frame (every 1/60th of a second). This means RNG manipulation requires pressing A with a 1/60th second precision, making it more difficult than the DS generation.

RNG manipulation for very rare traits can require waiting for a very long time (1h+ for each attempt). Fortunately, some advanced techniques exist [to speed up RNG advances](/e-tips-rng).

[vblanks](/gba-vblank) can cause hard to predict RNG frame advances during the Pokémon generation, altering the outcome unexpectely. Those unexpected frame advances are the source of the differences between [Methods 1-4](/gba-methods).

Still, they are good reasons to RNG manipulate in GBA games, most notably:

- • Only way to obtain all Ribbons on a Pokémon
- • Only way to obtain Shiny Mew and Shiny Deoxys

### GBA RNG Mechanisms Overview

There is only 1 type of RNG for Pokémon generation. It is used to generate the PID (which dictates Nature, Ability, Shininess); and IVs.

Shininess depends on PID, TID, and SID. This means you must [know your SID](/gen3-sid) to RNG manipulate a shiny Pokémon.

### Key Differences between GBA Games

| Game                | Initial Seed                                                   |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ruby & Sapphire     | With live battery: Random.<br/>With dead battery: Normally 5A0 |
| Emerald             | Normally 0                                                     |
| FireRed & LeafGreen | Random                                                         |

[Pokémon Emerald](/emerald-overview) is the easiest game for RNG manipulation on retail and emulator without tool-assistance for:

- • Wild Pokémon
- • Stationnary Pokémon
- • Egg Pokémon

Ruby and Sapphire with a dead battery is also useful:

- • Because the initial seed is different than Emerald, the wait time for the same outcome as Emerald can occur more quickly.
- • Access to level 45 Groudon and Kyogre (level 70 on Emerald)

FireRed and LeafGreen also have specific purposes such as:

- • Only way to get Shiny Mewtwo, Unown
- • Easiest way to get Shiny Articuno, Zapdos, Moltres

### Console Interoperability

Pokémon can be traded between GBA and GameCube games.

GameCube games are specifically useful for:

- • Only way to obtain [Shiny Jirachi](/emulator-rs-wishmaker)
- • Obtaining Entei, Raikou, Suicune with rare traits is easier than on GBA games.

Pokémon can be transfered from GBA to DS games, but not the other way around.
