## Particularities of GBA RNG Manipulation

- In GBA games, the RNG frame advances every in-game frame (every 1/60th of a second).

  - This means RNG manipulation requires pressing A with a 1/60th second precision, making it more difficult than the DS generation.
  - RNG manipulation for very rare traits can require waiting for a very long time (1h+ for each attempt).
    - Fortunately, some advances techniques exist [to speed up RNG advances](/e-tips-rng).
  - [v-blanks](/gba-v-blank) can cause hard to predict RNG frame advances during the Pokémon generation, altering the outcome unexpectely
    - Those unexpected frame advances are the source of the differences between [Methods 1-4](/gba-methods).

- Still, they are good reasons to RNG manipulate in GBA games, most notably:
  - Required for Ribbon Master (Obtaining all Ribbon on a Pokémon)
  - Only way to obtain Shiny Mew and Shiny Deoxys

## GBA RNG Mechanisms Overview

- There is only 1 type of RNG called PID RNG.
  - It is used to generate the PID (which dictates Nature, Ability, Shininess), and IVs.
- Shininess depends on PID, TID, and SID.
  - This means you must [know your SID](/gen3-sid) to RNG manipulate a shiny Pokémon.

## Key Differences between GBA Games

| Game                | Initial Seed                                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Ruby & Sapphire     | With live battery: Random.<br/>With dead battery: Always 5A0 |
| Emerald             | Always 0                                                     |
| FireRed & LeafGreen | Random                                                       |

[Pokémon Emerald](/emerald-overview) is the easiest game for RNG manipulation on retail and emulator without tool-assistance for
- Wild Pokémon
- Stationnary Pokémon
- Egg Pokémon

Ruby and Sapphire with a dead battery is also useful:
  - Because the initial seed is different than Emerald, the wait time for the same outcome as Emerald can occur more quickly.
  - Access to level 45 Groudon and Kyogre (level 70 on Emerald)

FireRed and LeafGreen also have specific purposes such as
  - Only way to get Shiny Mewtwo, Unown
  - Easiest way to get Shiny Articuno, Zapdos, Moltres

## Interoperability
- Pokémon can be traded between GBA and GameCube games.
  - Pokémon Colosseum Bonus Disc (US) and Pokémon Channel (EU) are the only way to obtain [Shiny Jirachi](/emulator-rs-wishmaker).
  - It is easier to RNG manipulate Shiny Entei, Raikou, Suicune on Pokémon Colosseum than on GBA games.

- Pokémon can be transfered from GBA to DS games, but not the other way around.
