This article assumes you have already read [Understanding VBlanks](/gba-vblank)

## Method 1
Here's the game logic for generating a Pokémon:

| Step          | Frame At Step Start | Frame At Step End |
| ----------------- | --------------------|-------------------|
| Generate 1st half PID      | 1      | 2 |
| Generate 2nd half PID      | 2      | 3 |
| Generate Def, Atk, HP IVs      | 3      | 4 |
| Generate SpD, SpA, Spe IVs      | 4      | 5 |

Method 1 is when a Pokémon is generated and no vblanks occur. The Pokémon is generated using the value of the RNG of frames 1,2,3,4.

## Method 2
Method 2 is when a vblank occurs between the steps "Generate 2nd half PID" and "Generate Def, Atk, HP IVs".

| Step          | Frame At Step Start | Frame At Step End |
| ----------------- | --------------------|-------------------|
| Generate 1st half PID      | 1      | 2 |
| Generate 2nd half PID      | 2      | 3 |
| VBLANK: Update RNG frame  | 3 | 4 |
| Generate Def, Atk, HP IVs      | 4      | 5 |
| Generate SpD, SpA, Spe IVs      | 5      | 6 |

The Pokémon is generated using the value of the RNG of frames 1,2,4,5. The RNG value of frame 3 is unused.


## Method 4
Method 4 is when a vblank occurs between the steps "Generate Def, Atk, HP IVs" and "Generate SpD, SpA, Spe IVs".

| Step          | Frame At Step Start | Frame At Step End |
| ----------------- | --------------------|-------------------|
| Generate 1st half PID      | 1      | 2 |
| Generate 2nd half PID      | 2      | 3 |
| Generate Def, Atk, HP IVs      | 3      | 4 |
| VBLANK: Update RNG frame  | 4 | 5 |
| Generate SpD, SpA, Spe IVs      | 5      | 6 |

The Pokémon is generated using the value of the RNG of frames 1,2,3,5. The RNG value of frame 4 is unused.





## RNG Manipulation Techniques
- Finding your [SID](/gen3-sid), which is required to RNG manipulate a shiny Pokémon.

- Manipulating your TID/SID, to reduce the wait time for specfic shiny Pokémon.

- Shortening the wait time to reach high RNG frames
  - [Resetting RNG frame with Painting](/emerald-painting-rng)
  - [Saving and restoring RNG frame with Battle Video](/e-tips-rng)

- Improving timing accuracy by reducing noise-related delays with [Trainer Card flip](/e-tips-rng)


## Particularities of Emerald RNG Manipulation
 - Check [Particularities of GBA RNG Manipulation](/gba-overview)

 - Pokémon Emerald is the easiest GBA game for RNG manipulation because its initial seed is normally 0.
