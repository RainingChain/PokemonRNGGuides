In Sootopolis City, two brothers are looking for the largest Lotad and Seedot (in Emerald) or Barboach and Shroomish (in Ruby and Sapphire). The reward for showing a Pokémon that exceeds the previous record is an Elixir (and the satisfaction of beating the record).

## Step 1: Find the number of days since the game savefile was created

If you have a dead battery, this step is not needed.

Talk to the scientist in the Mossdeep Space Center to know the number of rockets launched. This indicates the number of weeks since your savefile was created.

## Step #2: Catch a Pokémon matching the PID pattern

Fill the form below to find the relevant PID pattern, and the earliest frame for a Pokémon generated with Method-1 to match that pattern.

The Pokémon recommended to catch with Method-1 is any of the stationnary Kecleon, but any will do. Wild Pokémon generated with other Methods also work, but they are harder to RNG manipulate.

Because the rocket launch count only gives an approximation of the days passed (± 7 days), it is recommended to aim for a PID pattern at least 6 days in the future. Otherwise, in the worst case, you'll need to catch 7 Pokémon (one for each day of the week).
